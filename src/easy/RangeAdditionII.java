/**
 * Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.
 * <p>
 * Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.
 * <p>
 * You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * m = 3, n = 3
 * operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * Initially, M =
 * [[0, 0, 0],
 * [0, 0, 0],
 * [0, 0, 0]]
 * <p>
 * After performing [2,2], M =
 * [[1, 1, 0],
 * [1, 1, 0],
 * [0, 0, 0]]
 * <p>
 * After performing [3,3], M =
 * [[2, 2, 1],
 * [2, 2, 1],
 * [1, 1, 1]]
 * <p>
 * So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
